# Advent of Code Solutions

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
programming puzzles. These Christmas themed programming puzzles are released
each December by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

I have a folder for each year that I have done problems in. I usually try to
match these problem sets with a new programming language that I am learning. So
most of the years will be done in a single language with varying degrees of
success.

I have included readme's within each year for instructions on how to run the
solutions.

These puzzles are really fun and a great way to dive into learning something
new. Thanks Eric for making these yearly events possible.
