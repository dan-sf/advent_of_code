# Aoc 2023

For this year I am using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) for my solutions. I
decided to create a small template generator framework to initialize the setup
for the project. I wanted to do this so I could get more experience with the
`mix` tool. I might clean it up and pull it out as a separate repo if it seems
like others would want to use it as well.

The starter code draws inspiration from the
[advent-of-code-elixir-starter](https://github.com/mhanberg/advent-of-code-elixir-starter)
project. I didn't use that mostly because I wanted a slightly different setup
and also wanted to learn more about `mix`.
